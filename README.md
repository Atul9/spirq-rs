# SPIR-Q

SPIR-Q is a light weight library for SPIR-V pipeline metadata query, which can be very useful for dynamic graphics/compute pipeline construction, shader debugging and so on. BTW, SPIR-Q currently only depends on the Rust standard library.

## Usage

The project is still in progress, but some of the functionalities are already in good shape. Please refer to the attached [example](examples/query/main.rs).
